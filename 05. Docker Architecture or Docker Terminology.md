Great question 👍 Let’s go through **Docker architecture and key terminology** so you have a strong foundation before working with AKS (since AKS runs containers).

# 🐳 **Docker Architecture**

Docker follows a **client-server model**:

1. **Docker Client**

   * Command-line tool (`docker` command).
   * Sends requests to the Docker Daemon (e.g., `docker run nginx`).

2. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**

   * Runs on the host machine.
   * Builds, runs, and manages containers.
   * Listens for requests from the client.

3. **Docker Images**

   * Read-only templates (blueprints) for containers.
   * Example: `nginx:latest`.

4. **Docker Containers**

   * Running instances of Docker images.
   * Lightweight, isolated environments.

5. **Docker Registry**

   * Stores and distributes Docker images.
   * Public: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
   * Private: Azure Container Registry (ACR), AWS ECR, etc.

# 📖 **Docker Terminology**

* **Image** → A blueprint (immutable, read-only) of your app (code + runtime + libs).
* **Container** → A running instance of an image (isolated process).
* **Dockerfile** → A script with instructions to build a Docker image.
* **Volume** → A way to persist data outside the container’s lifecycle.
* **Port Mapping** → Exposing container ports to the host (`-p 8080:80`).
* **Registry** → A storage/repository for images (Docker Hub, ACR).
* **Tag** → Version identifier for images (e.g., `myapp:v1`).
* **Layer** → Each step in a Dockerfile creates a layer; layers are cached & reused.
* **Compose** → Tool (`docker-compose.yml`) for defining and running multi-container apps.
* **Swarm** → Docker’s native clustering/orchestration (Kubernetes is more widely used today).

# 🖼️ **Simplified Flow**

1. Write a **Dockerfile** → `docker build` → creates an **image**.
2. Push image to a **registry**.
3. Run it → becomes a **container**.
4. Orchestrators (like **AKS**) manage many containers.

👉 Shyam, would you like me to create a **diagram of Docker architecture** so you can visually see how client, daemon, containers, and registry fit together?
