Perfect 👍 Since you’ve already looked at Docker, let’s now step up to **Kubernetes architecture** — because Kubernetes (and AKS) is essentially the “orchestrator” for Docker containers.

# 🟦 **Kubernetes Architecture (High-Level)**

Kubernetes follows a **master–worker (control plane – node)** design.

---

## 🔹 1. **Control Plane (Master Components)**

This manages the **cluster state** (the brain of Kubernetes).

* **API Server (`kube-apiserver`)**

  * Frontend for the cluster.
  * All requests (kubectl, UI, REST) go through the API Server.

* **etcd**

  * Key-value store that holds the **cluster state** (like a database).

* **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`)**

  * Ensures the desired state = actual state.
  * Examples: Node Controller, ReplicaSet Controller.

* **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)**

  * Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and policies.

---

## 🔹 2. **Worker Nodes (Data Plane)**

This is where the **apps/containers actually run**. Each worker node has:

* **Kubelet**

  * Agent running on each node.
  * Talks to API Server, starts/stops containers using Container Runtime.

* **Kube-Proxy**

  * Manages networking & load balancing for services.

* **Container Runtime**

  * Runs the containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

---

## 🔹 3. **Key Kubernetes Objects**

These are the “building blocks” you interact with:

* **Pod** → Smallest unit; one or more containers grouped together.
* **Deployment** → Defines how many pod replicas should run, and manages rolling updates.
* **Service** → Exposes pods to other pods or to the outside world (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
* **Ingress** → Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic into the cluster.
* **ConfigMap/Secret** → Store configuration and sensitive data.
* **Namespace** → Logical separation of resources.

---

## 🔹 4. How it Works (Flow)

1. You define a **desired state** (e.g., 3 replicas of Nginx) via YAML/CLI.
2. **API Server** saves it in **etcd**.
3. **Scheduler** decides which node should run each Pod.
4. **Kubelet** on that node talks to **container runtime** to start the Pod.
5. **Kube-Proxy** enables networking so services can reach the Pod.
6. **Controllers** constantly check & maintain the desired state.

# 🖼️ **Simplified Mental Model**

* **Control Plane** = Management & brains.
* **Worker Nodes** = Execution & muscle.
* **K8s Objects** = The language you use to tell the system what you want.

👉 Do you want me to **draw a simple architecture diagram** (Control Plane vs Worker Nodes) so you can visualize how all these pieces fit together?
