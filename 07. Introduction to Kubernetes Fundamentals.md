Got it 👍 Let’s build a **clear foundation of Kubernetes fundamentals** step by step.

# 🟦 **Introduction to Kubernetes Fundamentals**

Kubernetes (often called **K8s**) is an **open-source container orchestration platform**.
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Think of it as the **“operating system for your containers”**.

---

## 🔹 Why Kubernetes?

* Containers are great (portable, lightweight, fast), but managing **hundreds/thousands** of them is hard.
* Kubernetes solves:

  * **Scaling** (auto add/remove containers).
  * **Resilience** (restart failed containers).
  * **Load balancing** (distribute traffic).
  * **Service discovery** (pods can find each other).
  * **Rolling updates** (zero downtime deployments).

---

## 🔹 Core Kubernetes Concepts

1. **Cluster**

   * A set of machines (nodes) managed by Kubernetes.
   * Two parts: **Control Plane** (brains) + **Worker Nodes** (run workloads).

2. **Pod**

   * The **smallest unit** in Kubernetes.
   * Wraps one or more containers that run together.

3. **Node**

   * A machine (VM or physical) where pods run.

4. **Deployment**

   * Manages pods (ensures desired replicas are running).
   * Handles rolling updates & rollbacks.

5. **Service**

   * Provides **stable networking** to access pods.
   * Types: **ClusterIP** (internal), **NodePort** (expose on node IP), **LoadBalancer** (cloud LB).

6. **Ingress**

   * Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access (like an API Gateway).

7. **ConfigMap & Secret**

   * Store configuration and sensitive info separately from code.

8. **Namespace**

   * Logical partition in a cluster (helps organize resources, e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`).

## 🔹 Kubernetes Workflow (Simplified)

1. You define a **desired state** (example: 3 replicas of an API) in YAML or with `kubectl`.
2. **API Server** stores it in **etcd**.
3. **Scheduler** decides which node runs each pod.
4. **Kubelet** runs containers via container runtime (Docker/containerd).
5. **Controllers** keep checking → if a pod crashes, a new one is started.

---

## 🔹 Example (Hello World in K8s)

```bash
# Create a Deployment
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=nginx

# Expose it as a Service
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Now you’ll get an **EXTERNAL-IP** → open it in a browser → Hello from Nginx 🚀

---

✅ That’s Kubernetes at its core:

* You describe what you want (desired state).
* Kubernetes makes sure reality matches it (self-healing, scaling, routing).

👉 Shyam, do you want me to prepare a **visual “Kubernetes Fundamentals Mind Map”** (pods, deployments, services, ingress, configmaps, namespaces) so you can quickly revise before interviews?
