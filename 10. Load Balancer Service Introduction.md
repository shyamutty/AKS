Perfect timing 👍 — now that you’ve seen Pods, let’s talk about **LoadBalancer Service** in Kubernetes, especially in **Azure AKS**.

---

## 🔹 What is a LoadBalancer Service?

* A **Kubernetes Service** exposes your Pods to the outside world.
* By default, Pods get **ephemeral IPs** that change — not stable for clients.
* Services solve this problem by giving a **stable endpoint (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer)**.

👉 **Types of Services:**

1. **ClusterIP (default):** Exposes Pods only inside the cluster.
2. **NodePort:** Exposes Pods via a port on each Node (accessible from outside with `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`).
3. **LoadBalancer:** Integrates with **cloud provider’s load balancer (Azure, AWS, GCP)** to provide a **public IP** for your service.

---

## 🔹 LoadBalancer in AKS

* When you create a **Service of type LoadBalancer**, AKS talks to **Azure Load Balancer** automatically.
* Azure provisions:

  * A **Public IP**
  * A **Load Balancer rule** that routes traffic to your Pods.

## 🔹 Example: Nginx Deployment with LoadBalancer

📄 **nginx-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

👉 Deploy it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

---

## 🔹 Test It

1. Get the Service:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc nginx-service
   ```

   You’ll see an **EXTERNAL-IP** column.
   (It might take 1–2 minutes for Azure to assign a public IP).

2. Open the IP in your browser:

   ```
   http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
   ```

   You’ll see the **Nginx welcome page** 🎉.

---

## 🔹 Key Notes

* **ClusterIP** → internal-only.
* **NodePort** → external but less user-friendly.
* **LoadBalancer** → best for production (in cloud environments like AKS).
* In production, you often use **Ingress + Ingress Controller (NGINX, Traefik)** for advanced routing + TLS.

👉 Do you want me to also show you **how Ingress differs from LoadBalancer** (with real-world scenarios like multiple apps on one IP)?
