Great 👍 Let’s dive into **Kubernetes Pods** — the **fundamental building block** of Kubernetes.

# 🟦 **What is a Pod?**

* A **Pod** is the **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
* It represents **one or more tightly coupled containers** running together on the same node.
* Containers in a Pod:

  * Share the **same network namespace** (same IP, same ports).
  * Can communicate via `localhost`.
  * Can share **storage volumes**.

👉 In most cases, **one Pod = one container** (but Pods can hold multiple if they must run together, e.g., sidecar pattern).

---

# 🔹 Key Characteristics of Pods

* **Ephemeral** → Pods are not permanent. If a Pod dies, Kubernetes can create a new one (but with a different name/IP).
* **Atomic Unit of Deployment** → You don’t deploy containers directly; you deploy Pods.
* **Managed by Controllers** → Usually, Pods are created by higher-level objects like **Deployments**, **ReplicaSets**, or **StatefulSets**.
* **Networking** → Each Pod gets a unique IP, but Pods are short-lived. That’s why we use **Services** for stable access.

# 🔹 Pod Lifecycle

1. **Pending** → Pod accepted by cluster but not yet running.
2. **Running** → All containers inside the Pod are up.
3. **Succeeded** → All containers terminated successfully.
4. **Failed** → At least one container failed.
5. **Unknown** → State couldn’t be determined.

# 🔹 Example: Simple Pod YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Deploy it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-nginx-pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod my-nginx-pod
```

---

# 🔹 Common Commands

* List all Pods:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
* Check details of a Pod:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
* Check logs of a Pod:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
* Exec into a Pod (like SSH):

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
  ```

---

✅ **In summary:**

* A Pod = **wrapper around containers** in Kubernetes.
* Pods are **short-lived**, so we use **Deployments/ReplicaSets** to keep them alive and scalable.

👉 Shyam, do you want me to also explain **why we don’t usually create Pods directly** in production, and instead use **Deployments**?
