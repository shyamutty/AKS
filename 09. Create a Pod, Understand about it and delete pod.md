Great, letâ€™s go step by step with **Kubernetes Pods** hands-on! ðŸš€

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Pod?

* **Pod** = Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
* It can contain **one or more containers** that share:

  * Networking (same IP, port space)
  * Storage (Volumes)
  * Lifecycle

Usually, **one container per Pod** is recommended unless they are tightly coupled (e.g., sidecar pattern).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Create a Pod (YAML + `kubectl`)

ðŸ“„ **pod-definition.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-first-pod
  labels:
    app: demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

ðŸ‘‰ Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yaml
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Verify Pod

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod my-first-pod
kubectl logs my-first-pod
```

Check if the Pod is **Running** and the container is ready.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Access Pod (Port Forward)

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/my-first-pod 8080:80
```

Now open ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see Nginx running.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Delete Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod
```

This removes the Pod. Since Pods are **ephemeral**, they wonâ€™t restart automatically unless managed by a **ReplicaSet / Deployment**.

---

âœ… You just:

* Created a Pod
* Explored its details
* Tested it locally
* Deleted it

---

Would you like me to next show you how to **create a Deployment** (which manages Pods and ensures high availability) so you donâ€™t lose the Pod when it crashes or is deleted?
