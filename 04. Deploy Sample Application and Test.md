Perfect 👍 Let’s go step by step to **deploy and test a sample application on AKS**. We’ll use a simple **Nginx web app** (lightweight and quick for testing).

---

# 🔹 1. Connect to Your AKS Cluster

Make sure your local `kubectl` is pointing to your cluster:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
kubectl get nodes
```

✅ You should see your worker nodes.

---

# 🔹 2. Deploy Sample Nginx Application

Create a Kubernetes **Deployment**:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

Check if deployment is running:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

---

# 🔹 3. Expose the App (Service)

Expose Nginx to the internet using a **LoadBalancer service**:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

Verify service:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Look for an **EXTERNAL-IP** (may take 1–2 minutes to provision in Azure).

---

# 🔹 4. Test the Application

* Copy the `EXTERNAL-IP` from above.
* Open in a browser:

  ```
  http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
  ```
* You should see the **default Nginx welcome page** 🎉

---

# 🔹 5. Scale the App (Optional Test)

Scale Nginx pods to handle more traffic:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Now 3 pods are running behind the same LoadBalancer.

---

# 🔹 6. Clean Up (Optional)

When done testing:

```bash
kubectl delete service nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
```

---

✅ You’ve now deployed, exposed, and tested your **first AKS app**.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to do the **same deployment using a YAML manifest** (so it’s more production-style and reusable)?
